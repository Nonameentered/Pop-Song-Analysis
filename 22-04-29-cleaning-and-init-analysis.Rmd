## Data Cleaning
### Artist Dataset
#### Cleaning + Subset of Interest
```{r}
dfArtists[dfArtists == "nan"] <- NA

# type (Person, Group, Orchestra, more (?))
# area.name <- looks like there are some states here, but mostly countries!
dfArtistsInterest <- dfArtists %>%
   dplyr::select(artist_id, type, gender) %>%
   # the objects need to be class "data frame" 
   as.data.frame()
```
#### Merge Artists with Songs
```{r}
dfSongsArtists <- merge(dfSongs,dfArtistsInterest,by="artist_id")
```

### Filter out NA's in Important Parameters
```{r Remove Missing}
cleaned_df <-dfSongsArtists %>%
  filter(!is.na(lyrics))  %>%
  filter(!is.na(artist))  %>%
  # filter(!is.na(gender))  %>%
  filter(!is.na(type))  %>%
  filter(!is.na(last_fm_listeners))  %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

```{r}
print("Pre-Cleaning # Songs")
dim(dfSongs)
print("Post Merge # Songs")
dim(dfSongsArtists)
print("Post-Cleaning Songs Remaining")
dim(cleaned_df)
```

### Gender
```{r}
# 944 artist id
unique(cleaned_df$gender)
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% 
    mutate(gender = replace(gender, gender == "other", "non-binary"))
# Alternative, use recode
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% 
    mutate(gender = replace(gender, is.na(gender), "group"))
cleaned_df %>% count(gender)
# Since the number of non-binary singers is small, we unfortunately remove them as we are unlikely to find strong conclusions about them
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% filter(gender != "non-binary")
dim(cleaned_df)
```

## Type
```{r}
unique(cleaned_df$type)
cleaned_df %>% count(type)
dim(cleaned_df)
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% filter(type %in% c("Group", "Person"))
dim(cleaned_df)
```

## Filter out Mismatches in Lyrics

```{r Remove Erroneous Lyrics}
# 
cleaned_df$lyrics <- str_replace_all(cleaned_df$lyrics,"[\\s]+", " ")
cleaned_df$cleaned_lyrics <- 
  str_replace_all(cleaned_df$lyrics, 'Chap\\. [0-9]', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'Listening Log', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'Favorite Songs Of', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'Chapter [0-9]', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'New Music ', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'Nominees', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., 'Best Songs of ', NA_character_) %>%
  str_replace_all(., "[0-9]+ U S", NA_character_) %>% # Court Cases
  str_replace_all(., "[0-9]+ U.S", NA_character_) %>% # Court Cases
  str_replace_all(.,"[ ]+", " ") %>%
  str_replace(., ".*Lyrics", "") %>%
  str_replace(., "[0-9]*Embed$", "")

cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(cleaned_lyrics)) %>%
  filter(levenshteinSim(track, str_match(lyrics, "(.*)Lyrics")[,2]) > .5) %>% # There are some false positives, when there are other languages
  as.data.frame()

# Filter away songs with less than 100 chars, must have been a mistake in lyrics
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% filter(nchar(cleaned_lyrics) > 100)
dim(cleaned_df)
```

## Readability
```{r}
cleaned_corpus <- corpus(
  cleaned_df,
  docid_field = "track_id",
  text_field = "cleaned_lyrics",
  unique_docnames = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
# We use FORCAST because it's one of the only readability metrics that don't look for sentences
cleaned_df$forcast <- textstat_readability(
  cleaned_corpus,
  measure = "FORCAST",
  min_sentence_length = 3,
  max_sentence_length = 10000,
)$FORCAST
cleaned_df$mean_word_syllables <- textstat_readability(
  cleaned_corpus,
  measure = "meanWordSyllables",
  remove_hyphens = TRUE,
  min_sentence_length = 3,
  max_sentence_length = 10000,
)$meanWordSyllables
```

### Check Lyrics
```{r, eval=FALSE}
suspects <- (cleaned_df %>% 
               filter(mean_word_syllables > 2) %>% 
               arrange(mean_word_syllables) %>%
               select(artist, track, cleaned_lyrics, mean_word_syllables))
suspects
for (row in 1:nrow(suspects)) {
  print(paste(suspects[row, "track"], " - ", suspects[row, "artist"], suspects[row, "mean_word_syllables"]))
  print(suspects[row, "cleaned_lyrics"])
}
```

## Filter to Relevant Details

```{r}
subset_df <- cleaned_df %>%
   dplyr::select(year, type, gender, last_fm_listeners, artist_appearances, rank, forcast, mean_word_syllables)
subset_df$log_listeners <- log(subset_df$last_fm_listeners)
subset_df$log_artist_appearances <- log(subset_df$artist_appearances)
subset_df$log_mean_word_syllables <- log(subset_df$mean_word_syllables)
attach(subset_df)
```

## Tests

### Correlation between log of number of listeners and rank (correlation, bootstrapped correlation)
```{r}
# Calculate and report the correlation along with the results of a parametric test of the significance of the correlation
cor1 <- cor(log_listeners, rank)
cor1test <- cor.test(log_listeners, rank)

# Calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the true correlation
N <- 10000
cors <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N)
{
  # log_listeners and rank have the same length, so we can use either
  s <- sample(1:length(log_listeners), length(log_listeners), replace = TRUE)
  
  cors[i] = cor(log_listeners[s], rank[s])
}
corsCI <- quantile(cors, c(0.025, 0.975))
print("95% confidence interval for the true correlation")
corsCI

# Display the results on a histogram (bootstrapped sample correlations, bootstrap confidence interval, and theoretical confidence interval)
hist(cors, main = "Bootstrap Correlations between Log of number of listeners and Rank", col = "blue")
abline(v = corsCI, lwd = 3, col = "red")
abline(v = cor1test$conf.int, lwd = 3, col = "green", lt = 2)
legend("topright", c("Theoretical CI", "Bootstrap CI"), lwd = 3, col = c("green", "red"), lty = c(2, 1))
```


### Difference in FORCAST readibility between male and female artists (t-test)
```{r}
# Check the normality of FORCAST data
qqPlot(forcast)

# Omit "Group" as a type to compare female and male artists
test1 <- t.test(forcast[gender != "group"] ~ gender[gender != "group"])
test1
```

### Difference in log of number of listeners between female and male artists (permutation test)
```{r}
# Transformed version of gender containing only solo artists (omitting the type "group")
soloGen <- gender[gender != "group"]

# The actual difference between the median log of number of listeners for females and males
actualDiff <- median(log_listeners[soloGen == "female"]) - median(log_listeners[soloGen == "male"])

# The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the log of number of listeners between female and male
# Assuming the null hypothesis is true, calculate the median for permutations of gender
diffValues <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in 1:N)
{
  fakeGender <- sample(soloGen)
  diffValues[i] <- median(log_listeners[fakeGender == "female"]) - median(log_listeners[fakeGender == "male"])
}

# A histogram of the differences in permuted sample medians between males and females, with the actual median difference shown
hist(diffValues, xlab = "Log of number of listeners", main = "Difference in median log of number of listeners between females and males", col = "red", 
     breaks = 20, cex.main = 0.7)
abline(v = actualDiff, col = "blue", lwd = 3)
text(actualDiff + 0.015, 1000, paste("Actual difference: ", round(actualDiff, 3)), srt = 90, cex = 0.9)

# Calculate and report the p-value
mean(abs(diffValues) >= abs(actualDiff))
```


### Predicting log of number of listeners based on Year, Type, and their interaction (ANCOVA)
```{r}
anc1 <- lm(log_listeners ~ year + type + year*type)
Anova(anc1, type = 3)
summary(anc1)
myResPlots2(anc1)
```
*Note: Seems like a lot of outliers and non-normal errors, but significant number of observations, so perhaps model assumptions are still close to being met? (also, no significant heteroskedasticity)*

### GLM and Backwards Stepwise Regression
```{r}
# Perform best-subsets regression (we use a significance level of 0.001, as some terms seem to have significantly lower initial p-values)
mod1 <- lm(log_listeners ~ gender + year + rank + forcast + mean_word_syllables + forcast*mean_word_syllables)
Anova(mod1, type = 3)

# Final model after removing all non-significant terms
mod2 <- lm(log_listeners ~ gender + year + rank)
summary(mod2)
myResPlots2(mod2)
```
*Note: Same observation as the one for the ANCOVA model.*
